# Action-games-vs-Misc-games-2012-2016-
Video games are growing in popularity and in order to get an edge in sales, video game studios have tried several different forms of innovation. Two such examples of these innovations are genre-mixing (from both similar and different genres) and new types of genres entirely. Despite this rise of new gaming genres, the Strait Research and MasterClass article both suggest that Action genre is the most popular gaming genre currently. This leads us to ask the question:  Are Action games still more popular than new innovative genres (Misc) in recent years (2012-2016)?
